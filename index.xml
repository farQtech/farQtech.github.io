      <description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.
I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

I am more inclined towards jobs which require me to relocate out of India as I want to expand my knowledge and experience different cultures but I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy to discuss any opportunity in Hyderabad too.
Flexible work timings.
Company size : should be ~200+ employees.
Colleagues I can learn from.
Stocks please!</description>
